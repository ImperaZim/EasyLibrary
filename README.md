## How to Use

To use EasyLibrary's features you can do it in 2 ways, use the one you find most interesting, I recommend using it as a plug for greater ease!
- **As a plugin:** Being the simplest way where you just need to add EasyLibrary.phar to your server and it will start all the library components, you can modify which components you want to keep active in the plugin's `config.yml` if you want!
- **As a inyernal library:** You must add it inside the plugin's src, keeping it in the root src folder for everything to work normally. Using this method, you will have to start the components yourself in your main.
